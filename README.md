##What is Maraschino?

This is a version of the official [Maraschino](https://github.com/mrkipling/maraschino) converted to work in the [Plex](http://plex.tv/) environment.

In addition, there's also a thread on the [Plex forums](https://forums.plex.tv/index.php/topic/104798-maraschino-for-plex-a-frontend-for-all-your-usenet-tools-now-with-plex-support/ "Plex forums") where most of the discussion happens.

You can find more information on the original version of Maraschiono for XBMC and setup instructions on the [project homepage](http://www.maraschinoproject.com/ "Maraschino Project homepage").

##What features does it have?

* **Customisable applications module** providing quick access to your web interfaces (e.g. SABnzb+, SickBeard or whatever else you want to link to).

* **Recently added episodes/movies/albums/pictures modules**.

* **Media library browser** - browse your entire movie and TV library.

* **SABnzbd+ and NZBGet modules** manage your nzb queue from within Maraschino - they appear when something is downloading and hide again when finished - shows you what is currently downloading, speed, time/MB remaining, and a progress bar. Control (pause, resume, speed limit) your downloads.

* **Usenet search** - search Usenet and add files directly to SABnzbd+ with the click of a button.

* **Currently playing bar** Shows you all the items playing from the server currently linked (inlcuding other users).

* **trakt.tv shouts module** which shows you what people are saying about the episode or movie that you're watching, and allows you to add your own shouts (requires a free trakt.tv account).

* **trakt.tv plus module** - see what your friends are watching, and view personalised TV and movie recommendations based on your viewing history.

* **Sickbeard module** which allows you to browse upcoming episodes and manage Sickbeard directly from Maraschino (add new shows, search for episodes, etc.).

* **NZBDrone module** which allows you to browse upcoming episodes and manage NZBDrone directly from Maraschino (in development).

* **CouchPotato module** which allows you to browse upcoming movies and manage CouchPotato directly from Maraschino (add new movies, etc.).

* **uTorrent and Transmission modules** for the torrent users among you.

* **Weather module** for your local city, because why not!

* Full-screen background image

* Customisable from within the application itself - choose how many columns you want, add new modules, rearrange them using drag-and-drop, and modify their settings without touching any settings files!

Uses Flask and some other awesome technologies (SQL-Alchemy, LESS CSS) but you don't need to know about that if you don't want to.

##What license is it released under?

It is released under the MIT License, [which can be found here](https://github.com/gugahoi/maraschino/blob/master/LICENSE).

##Why is it called Maraschino?

If your HTPC is an ice cream sundae then Maraschino is the cherry on top.
